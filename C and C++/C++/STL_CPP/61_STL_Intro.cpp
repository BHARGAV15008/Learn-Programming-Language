/*
-----   STL stands for Standard Template Library   -----
    * It is library of Generic Classes and Functions;
    * STL has well tested Classes and Functions;
    * Used in Competitive Programming;
    * Components of STL:
    *   - Containers - Used to store data (Used Template Classes);
    *   - Algorithms - Sorting, Searching (Used Tempalte Functions);
    *   - Iterators 
    *       -- Object which points to an elements in the containers;
    *       -- Handled just like pointer;
    *       -- Connects Algorithm with Containers;
    
    * Used to complete code or program in limited time and takes less timecomplexity:
    *   - Resize
    *   - Sort
    *   - Search

-----   COntainers   -----
    * There is three main types of containers:
        - Sequence Containers:
            -- Data stored in Linear fashion;
            -- Ex: Vector, List, Dequeue;
            1. Vector: 
                - Random Access Fast;
                - Insertion and Deletion in middle Slow;
                - Insertion at the end Fast;
            
            2. List:
                - Random Access Slow;
                - Insertion Fast;
                - Deletion Fast;

        - Associative Containers:
            -- Data stored like we have to Direct Accessed;
            -- Stored data like tree structures;
            -- Insertion and Deletion Fast;
            -- Access data is Fast;
            -- But we cannot Random Access;
            -- Ex: Set, MultiSet, Map, MultiMap;

        - Derived Containers:
            -- Stored data as Real world Modelling;
            -- Insertion, Deletion and Access data depends on Data structure;
            -- Ex: Stack, Queue, Priority-Queue;
