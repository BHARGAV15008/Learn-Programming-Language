/*
-----   Object Oriented Programming   -----
    -> Works on concept of classes and objects;
    -> Create class templates to create objects;
    -> Generated rules to access variable;
    -> Treat data as a critical elements;
    -> Gives code reusability;
    -> Gives secure coding;

    -> Elements or Terminology:
        * Classes: To generate blue print of projects;
        * Constructors
        * Destructors
        * Inheritance
        * Abstraction
        * Polymorphism
        * Encapsulation
        * Dynamic Binding
        * Message Passing


-----   Procedure Oriented Programming   -----
    * Here system main focus on function not on variables flow;
    * Function can either use local or global;
    * Data moves openly from function to function;
