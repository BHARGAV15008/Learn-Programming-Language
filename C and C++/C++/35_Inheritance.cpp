        - (A --> B, C --> D);

    * Multilevel Inheritance:
        - Single base class inherited derived class and derived class inherit to another class;
        - (A --> B --> C);

    * Multiple Inheritance:
        - Single derived class inherited by multiple base class;
        - (A --> C, B --> C);

    * Hierarachical Inheritance:
        - Multi derived class inherited by Single base class;
        - (A --> B, A --> C);
    
    * Hybrid Inheritance:
        - Combine of all inheritance;
        - (A --> B, A --> C, AC --> D);
